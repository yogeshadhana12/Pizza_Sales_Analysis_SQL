# Pizza_Sales_Analysis_SQL
This project involves a deep-dive analysis of a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza shop. Using SQL, I extracted, cleaned, and analyzed data to uncover key insights into consumer behavior, sales performance, and product popularity. The goal was to answer critical business questions that help optimize inventory and increase revenue.
